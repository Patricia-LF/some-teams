        <p><strong>Description:</strong> This is our first assignment in programming, where we had to create a website about The women's Champions League teams, using an already made array about the teams. I also created a page with more information about each team, and this page with information about me as the creator of this website.
            I'm a Real-Madrid fan, and have followed the men's team for several years.</p>
